# Personal Portfolio Site With React, Sanity, and Netlify

netlify deploy: https://kelli-portfolio.netlify.app

This page is designed to showcase my skills in React and Frontend - it features several sections: a landing section, about me, a tech portfolio, tech skills, testimonials, and a contact me section. I particularly enjoyed learning about Higher Order Components in order to create the scroll bar on the right side of the screen, and the social media links on the lower left of the screen. The site is responsive and features the motion library to have a bit of animation as you scroll the page. When I finished, I converted the project to TypeScript, and I also used Netlify forms to capture the input fields. 

It is connected to Sanity for backend, and I use the backend to populate most of the frontend sections (testimonials, skills, experience.)
